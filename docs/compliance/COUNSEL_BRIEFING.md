# Screel — Counsel Briefing Packet

**Prepared for:** outside counsel (App Store / IP / US gambling–consumer)  
**Product:** Screel  
**Repo:** https://github.com/kevinxiang5/screel  
**Prepared:** 2026-07-13  
**Status:** Engineering compliance pack — **not legal advice**

---

## What we need from counsel (written answers)

1. Is v1 “simulated gambling” under US federal/state framing if currency is **only screen-time minutes** with **no cash-out / redeem**?
2. Required age floor and disclosures (17+ vs 18+)?
3. Can marketing use Apple’s “Screen Time” product name? Preferred substitute wording?
4. Should the App Store publisher be an **LLC** (or other entity) rather than an individual?
5. Confirm **United States only** for v1; any state-level issues with social-casino + wellbeing framing?
6. Clearance notes on the mark **“Screel”** (USPTO / common law) — see `docs/compliance/TRADEMARK_SEARCH.md`.

**Gate:** Do not submit to App Review until a written memo exists covering 1–5.

## App Store stance we intend

- Territory: **US only** for v1
- Age rating: **Simulated Gambling = Frequent** (expect 17+/18+)
- Guideline path: **5.3 simulated**, **not** 5.3.4 real-money gaming
- Explicit disclosure: *No real money gambling. Minutes are fictional chip units.*
- No Made for Kids

## Recommended publisher

Prefer an **LLC** (or similar) as the App Store Connect seller for gambling-adjacent / regulated-field signaling. Confirm with counsel.
